# PetKeeper
This project aims to help manage all the things you need to keep track of with your pets.    
Such as:
- Feeding schedule and diet
- Medication schedule and perscription
- Training intinerary
- Pet friendly locations (Park, Restuarant/Pub, etc...)
- Pet activity log
    - help identify when your pet may be sick
    - know things are going ok while on vacation
    - keep track of training sessions with notes
- Share pet profiles with pet sitter to easily share what the pet needs, and see that it is being kept up on.

### Future
- More inclusive of other pets (mostly will be about dogs at first)
- integrations with vets and pet resorts?
